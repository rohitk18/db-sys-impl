# Database System Implementation (UF)

Participant: Rohit Karumuri (9097-1158)

This is a course project that involves building and designing a full-fledged database system that returns records based on the query given as input in the command line interface.
The database type is column-based and the project is implemented in C++.

## Project1
This project includes accessing tables and records in the tables and also extracts raw data to table data.

## Project2a
This project involves using Big Queue write a sorting algorithm to sort the data based on a given query.

## Project2b
This project involves making sorted tables from the raw table using Big Queue by splitting the data and merging them.

## Project3
This project involves relational operations from inputting query to outputting records using pipes. The operations include file selection, pipe selection, table join, distinct, sum, groupby and writing out processed data.

## Project4a
This part includes building statistics to tables.

## Project4b
This part includes building nodes of input query which represents the relational operations.

## Project5
This is the final portion of the project where all components of previous projects developed are linked together to output data based on given input query.
